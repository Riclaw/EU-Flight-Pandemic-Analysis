# EXPLORING EFFECTIVE STRATEGIES: AN ANALYSIS OF EUROPEAN AVIATION NETWORK AND RESTRICTIVE MEASURES TO CONTROL PANDEMIC OUTBREAKS

## Abstract:
During the COVID-19 pandemic, governments faced immense pressure as they implemented
drastic measures to combat the spread of the virus. One urgent issue that emerged was the
reopening of borders between countries. This need arose due to a variety of reasons, including
economic, social, humanitarian, and diplomatic considerations. This study aims to delve into
the role of the aviation network in the spread of epidemics, with the goal of determining the
most effective restrictive measures to prevent a pandemic outbreak.
To achieve this objective, a SEIR-ABM is applied. The model examines five distinct scenarios,
comparing them to the baseline scenario where no restrictions are imposed. By doing so, the
study aims to comprehensively analyze the impact of various restrictive measures implemented
in order to effectively understand their effects on the overall dynamics of the pandemic.
The findings reveal that implementing a full lockdown is the most effective measure in
combating the spread of the new epidemic followed by the implementation of quarantine for
symptomatic individuals, probably a more viable solution, also from an economic and social
perspective. Moreover, this study will show that the starting airport where the first infected
individual is placed does not seem to be relevant and, in addition to this, it will also show that
promptness in taking actions is crucial to prevent a pandemic from spreading.
