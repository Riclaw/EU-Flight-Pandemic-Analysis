s# EXPLORING EFFECTIVE STRATEGIES: AN ANALYSIS OF EUROPEAN AVIATION NETWORK AND RESTRICTIVE MEASURES TO CONTROL PANDEMIC OUTBREAKS


### Abstract
This study investigates the role of the aviation network in the spread of epidemics, focusing on finding the most effective restrictive measures to prevent pandemic outbreaks. A SEIR-ABM model was applied to examine five scenarios against a baseline scenario with no restrictions. The study identifies the full lockdown as the most effective measure, followed by quarantine for symptomatic individuals. The starting airport's location and promptness in implementing measures were found to be crucial in controlling pandemic spread.

### Introduction
The research underscores the aviation network's significant role in spreading contagious diseases and the need for effective management strategies. The study aims to fill gaps in existing literature by analyzing the European aviation network's role in epidemic spread, focusing on both symptomatic and asymptomatic agents.

### Model Description
The study uses a SEIR model combined with an Agent-Based Model (ABM) framework, focusing on the European aviation network from January-April 2023. This approach allows for dynamic representation of individual behavior and interaction within the network, considering variables like location, travel patterns, and infection status.

### Scenarios Analyzed
1. **Baseline (No Intervention)**
2. **Quarantine for Symptomatic Individuals**
3. **Quarantine for Symptomatic Individuals and Closure of 5 Airports**
4. **Closure of 5 Most Connected Airports**
5. **Quarantine for Symptomatic Individuals and Mandatory Mask Wearing**
6. **Full Lockdown**

### Conclusions
The study confirms that stricter containment measures have a greater positive impact on controlling epidemics. Full lockdown is the most effective, though economically and socially challenging. Quarantine for symptomatic individuals can be a viable alternative with a lower infectivity rate. The closure of individual airports shows limited impact due to the high interconnectivity of the European aviation network. Prompt action is essential for effective epidemic control.
